    Thank you for purchasing my script and supporting my work :D I hope this will enrich your server.
	Make sure you've followed the installation instructions and activated your license if you haven't already.

	Using a leak? That's okay -- sometimes it's hard to justify splashing out on a new server, for example.
	But please be safe - the VAST majority of leaks contain backdoors and malicious code that can destroy
	your server and attract malicious players.

	If your server is successful, don't forget to support the creators who provided you with their hard work.

	This Lua file allows you to configure Billy's Keypads.

	PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE IN NOTEPAD - IT'S LIKE TRYING TO DO SURGERY WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE.
	Use one of these:
	https://www.sublimetext.com/
	https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/
	https://code.visualstudio.com/

	Unfortunately I cannot provide support regarding configuring the addon as I would just get flooded and wouldn't
	have time to help people with bugs or errors so please reach out to friends or the Internet if you need help.

	It follows the same syntax as actual Lua code so if you make a typo you are likely to break it. Be careful.

	Don't change anything in this file except for the settings themselves unless you know what you are doing.

	This config file uses Simplerr (the same thing DarkRP uses) to help you understand any errors.
	https://fptje.github.io/glualint-web/ can also help you debug your config file.

	Good luck, have fun :D
